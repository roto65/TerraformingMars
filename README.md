# Terraforming Mars

Project developed following the directives of the **Building UIs** project assignment.

## Project Description

In this project we developed an Android application that can be used to keep track of the game resources while playing the **Terraforming Mars** board game.

Inside the Android Studio project two different modules can be found:

  - *app-compose* : the UI is defined using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose), the modern toolkit for building native Android UI
  - *app-legacy* : the interface is built applying the declarative approach with XML files

## IDE

This project was developed entirely in Google's **Android Studio Koala | 2024.1.1**.

If you want to clone this repository and take a look at the code we strongly suggest to use the same IDE as the 
repository already contains all the configuration files to run gradle scripts.

This project uses the **Gradle 8.7.0** build tool, via **Android Gradle Plugin 8.5.0**, to manage dependencies and compile the code into an Android executable.
